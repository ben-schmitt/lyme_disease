    "#Making a Choropleth Map using Altair\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial I decided to use a map to explore changes in Lyme disease occurrence over time. The CDC collects and publishes data on Lyme disease cases in the United States. The data is reported in various ways. I choose to look at cases per county aggregated over several year periods. The incidence of Lyme is related to the abundance of certain species of ticks, which varies from year to year. Looking at human cases of Lyme disease summed over several years helps to understand the overall trends in cases by reducing the signal caused by fluctuations in tick abundance. (The data set I used is available here: https://data.cdc.gov/browse?q=LymeDisease_9211_county&sortBy=relevance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. Early symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, neck stiffness and swollen lymph nodes. If untreated, later symptoms can include  joint pain and neurological problems. It is definitely a disease I would prefer not to get. The disease was first documented near Lyme Connecticut, hence the name, in 1970s. The number of Lyme disease cases per year is trending higher and changes in geographic location of cases have also been observed.  I want to understand how the number and location of Lyme disease cases has changed over time. Visualizing changes in Lyme disease occurrence over time could help health professionals and the public understand risk and implement risk management strategies. It could also help me avoid recreating in areas with a high number of Lyme disease cases.\n",

    "#Visualization Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose to visualize the CDC Lyme disease data using a choropleth map. Choropleth maps use intensity of color to encode a variable representing some attribute of a particular geographic unit. In the following visualizations I will use color intensity to encode the number of Lyme disease cases per state or county. Maps are useful for understanding all kinds of information especially geographic information. It’s much easier to visualize where something is happening by looking at a map rather than reading coordinates, or a county name. Since the CDC Lyme disease data is reported by State and county, I thought a choropleth map would be a good way to visualize it. It's kind of obvious but a map is only good for displaying data with a location component."

The source is available here: https://github.com/altair-viz/altair.\n",

One drawback of using Altair to make maps is that it does not seem to support interactive map visualizations at this time.\n"
